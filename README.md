# dimensionality-reduction-methods
This is the relization of mutiple dimensionality reduction methods.

ADLPP is my algorithm which combined the “coarse to fine” idea of LAPP with the idea of Supervised learning, which could not only preserve the local information after projection, solve the problem of noises and obtain the optimal subspaces, but also gain better performance on classification.
